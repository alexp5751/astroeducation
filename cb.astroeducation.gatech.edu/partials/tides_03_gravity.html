        <h3>Equation of Gravity</h3></p>
    <p>
        Isaac Newton found a single equation which demonstrates the relationships between distance and mass when computing gravity. The <i>force of gravity</i> between any two objects is equal to the product of the masses of both objects, divided by the
        square of the distance, all multiplied by a constant.
    </p>
    <h3>Here’s the formula to calculate the force of gravity between any two objects:</h3>

    <h3>Mathematics of Mass</h3>
    <p>Assuming all other variables remain constant, the greater the product of the masses of the objects, the greater the gravitational force. The converse holds true as well. The smaller the product of the masses, the weaker the gravitational force.</p>

    <br/>
    <p>We have to compare the force of the moon and the apple. Going to the gravity equation, and ignoring values constant between the apple and the moon, we’re comparing m/r<sup>2</sup> of the apple and moon.The moon has 7x10<sup>23</sup> times the mass
        of the apple. Meanwhile, the distance is 100 times that of the moon. So, the force generated by the moon will be 7x10<sup>23</sup>/10<sup>2</sup> times greater than that of the apple.</p>

    <br/>
    <h3>Defining Distance</h3>
    <p>As the distance between the two masses decreases, the greater the force of gravity will be for those two objects. The converse holds true: as the distance between two masses increases, the smaller the force of gravity will be for those objects.</p>
